# Object Detection
>Use the CNN model to classify objects
>
CIFAR10 data set was used in this project. Object detection was performed on this data set using CNN. The aim of the project is to observe the effect of the parameters and methods used in the model on the model accuracy score while object detection. Therefore, various parameters and methods were used in the CNN models created in the project, six models were created to observe the performances. The results of the models are shown as plots and table. Thus, all models are compared.
