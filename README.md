# Object Detection
>Use the CNN model to classify objects

CIFAR10 data set was used in this project. Object detection was performed on this data set using CNN. While using CNN in the project, many parameters were changed, the model was changed and six models were created to achieve the best performance. The results obtained as a result of the models were shown as plots and shown in a table. Thus, all models are compared.
